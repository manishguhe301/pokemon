# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Running the App

To run the app, use the following command: `npm run dev`

This will start the development server. You can access the app at `http://localhost:5173/`.

Enjoy coding!
